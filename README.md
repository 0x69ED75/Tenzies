# Tenzies

This is my second React project, which is a simple game called Tenzies.

Tenzies is a game where you roll 10 dice, with the aim to have all dice have the same value.

Furthermore, this app will track your best scores and your average score.

The game is playable at this URL: https://0x69ed75.github.io/Tenzies/

## Rules
The rules of Tenzies are simple:
- 10 dice are repeatedly rolled, and it is your job to make sure every dice has the same number.
- You may click a die at anytime to freeze its current state, so that when it is rerolled, its number doesn't change.
- Once all 10 dice read the same number, you win.

## Technologies used
- HTML
- CSS
- React
- GitHub Pages

Furthermore, I learnt how to manipulate a browsers local storage to store information about the user's best score and
their average score between sessions.
